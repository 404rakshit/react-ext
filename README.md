This is the README for my extension "react-ext". I made a steup for a vscode extension with react, typescript, tailwind along with vscode ui toolkit lib.

## Installation

First install in the root directory

```
npm install
```
Then, moving to the react directory, install the packages

```
cd web
npm install
```

Then run the script with, `npm start` or you can build with `npm run build`, inside `web` parcel with up and running with

```
npm start
```

## Development

Now you can enjoy your development while pressing `Ctrl + F5` and in the popup window by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and chosing `React Web View` from the commands palete.

Got a dedicated blog for Understanding [VS Code Extension](https://dev.to/rakshit47/create-vs-code-extension-with-react-typescript-tailwind-1ba6).
